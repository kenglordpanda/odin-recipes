      <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup butter, sliced - divided</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 to 12
        minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
        Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
        minutes; drain and discard grease.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to a bowl and mix in spaghetti sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Place 1/2 of the butter slices into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole
        dish.Spread 1/2 of the spaghetti into the dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl;
        spread mixture over spaghetti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with remaining spaghetti and top with remaining slices of butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese on top
        and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly browned,
        about 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
