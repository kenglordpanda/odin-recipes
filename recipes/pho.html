    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all Ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1
        teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat
        and simmer broth for about 2 hours
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and
        preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum
        foil
      </li>
      <li>
        Place oniions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and
        cook under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until
        vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside
        separately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and
        charred onions to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick,
        peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to
        broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining two teaspoons salt.
        Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer the
        better). Season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones
        for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim and discord fat from the top of chilled borth. Pour broth into a
        pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and
        let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper thin slices.</li>
      <li>
        Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top
        each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
